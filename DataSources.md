## NC DPI School Accountability disaggregated data

Main site for the data is here: http://www.ncpublicschools.org/accountability/reporting/leaperformancearchive/

Data for the last three years is stored as zipped data. The 2015-2016 school year, for example, may be found here: http://www.ncpublicschools.org/docs/accountability/reporting/disag1516.zip

Data sets for 2012-2013 and prior may be found here: http://accrpt.ncpublicschools.org/docs/disag_datasets/.

It'd be real cool if there were a codebook or something to help me understand what this data is.
